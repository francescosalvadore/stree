STREAmS flow cases
===================================

STREAmS has been tailored to carry out DNS of three 
types of canonical compressible flow configurations:

- compressible plane channel flow, 
- compressible boundary layer over a flat plate, 
- shock wave/boundary layer interaction generated by oblique shock impingement.

For all the flow cases, :math:`x` indicates the streamwise coordinate, 
:math:`y` indicates the wall-normal coordinate, and :math:`z` indicates the 
spanwise coordinate.  
The dimensions of the computational domain in the corresponding directions
are :math:`L_x`, :math:`L_y`, and :math:`L_z`.

-------------------------------------
Nondimensional governing equations
-------------------------------------

STREAmS solves the fully compressible Navierâ€“Stokes equations 
for a calorically or thermally perfect, heat-conducting gas. 
The governing equations in dimensional form, adopting
the Einsten summation notation, are thus:

.. math::

   \frac{\partial \rho^*}{\partial t^*} + \frac{\partial \rho^* u_i^*}{\partial x_i^*}  = 0

.. math::

   \frac{\partial \rho^* u_i^*}{\partial t^*} + \frac{\partial \rho^* u_i^*}{\partial x_j^*} = -\frac{\partial p^*}{\partial x_i^*} + \frac{\partial \sigma_{ij}^*}{\partial x_j^*}

.. math::

   \frac{\partial \rho^* E^*}{\partial t^*} + \frac{\partial \rho^* u_j^* H^*}{\partial x_j^*} = - \frac{\partial q_j^*}{\partial x_j^*} + \frac{\sigma_{ij}^* u_i^*}{\partial x_j^*}

.. math::

   p^* = \rho^* R^* T^*

where we indicate dimensional quantities with the asterisk symbol. 
In particular, :math:`\rho^*` is the density, 
:math:`u_i^*` are the velocity components in the three coordinate directions, 
:math:`p^*` is the pressure, 
:math:`\sigma^*_{ij}` is the viscous stress tensor, 
:math:`E^*` is the total specific energy defined 
as :math:`E^* = e^* + u_i^* u_i^*/2`, 
:math:`H^*` is the total specific enthalpy, defined 
as :math:`H^* = E^* + p^*/\rho^*`, 
and :math:`R^*` is the gas constant.

For the general case of a thermally perfect gas, the specific internal energy
and enthalpy are defined respectively as 

.. math::

   e^* = \int_{T_R^*}^{T^*} C_v^*(T^*)\,\mathrm{d} T^* \quad \mathrm{and} \quad 
   h^* = \int_{T_R^*}^{T^*} C_p^*(T^*)\,\mathrm{d} T^* \, .

where :math:`T_R^*` is the reference temperature, and 
:math:`C_p` and :math:`C_v` are respectively the specific heat capacity 
at constant pressure and volume, which are assumed in general as functions 
of the temperature. 

The constitutive equations defining the viscous stress tensor and 
the heat flux vector are: 

.. math::

   \sigma_{ij}^* = \mu^* \left( \frac{\partial u_i^*}{\partial x_j^*} 
                              + \frac{\partial u_j^*}{\partial x_i^*}
                  - \frac{2}{3} \frac{\partial u_k^*}{\partial x_k^*} 
                                                          \delta_{ij} \right)

.. math::

   q_j^* = - k^* \frac{\partial T^*}{\partial x^*_j} = - \frac{\mu^* C_p^*}{Pr} \frac{\partial T^*}{\partial x^*_j}

where :math:`\mu^*` is the dynamic viscosity, evaluated as a 
function of the temperature, and :math:`k^*` is the thermal 
conductivity, expressed in terms of the Prandtl number :math:`Pr`
as :math:`k^* = \mu^* C_p^*/Pr`.

For the viscosity-temperature relationship, two options are available:

.. math::

   \mu^* = \mu^*(T_R^*) f(T^*/T^*_R) = \mu^*(T_R^*) \cdot 
   \begin{cases}
   \left(\frac{T^*}{T_R^*}\right)^\alpha & \mathrm{Power\,law}\\
   \frac{T^*}{T_R^*} \frac{1 + S^*/T_R^*}{T^*/T_R^* + S^*/T_R^*} & \mathrm{Sutherland's\,law}\\\,
   \end{cases}

where :math:`\alpha` and :math:`S^*` are coefficients that depend on the fluid.

In order to obtain the nondimensional form of the governing equations, 
we define the following reference quantities. The specific choice assumed 
makes it possible to use nondimensional variables, while retaining 
-- almost -- the same form that the governing equations have when using 
dimensional variables. 

In particular, we assume that density, temperature, and lengths are  
made nondimensional as:

.. math::

   \rho = \frac{\rho^*}{\rho^*_R}, \quad T = \frac{T^*}{T^*_R}, \quad x_i = \frac{x^*_i}{L_R^*}

From the reference values chosen above, it follows that:

.. math:: 

   p_R^* = \rho_R^* R^* T^*_R \quad \mathrm{and} \quad U_R^* = \sqrt{R^* T^*_R}\,.

implying that :math:`p = p^*/P^*_R`, and :math:`u_i = u_i^*/U_R^*`.

Note that the reference velocity is equal to the speed of sound evaluated at the reference temperature, except for the factor :math:`\sqrt{\gamma}`.

The nondimensional time is :math:`t = t^*/t^*_R`, where the 
reference time is assumed to be equal to:

.. math:: 

   t_R^* = \frac{L_R^*}{U_R^*}\,.

Specific heat capacities are instead made nondimensional as:

.. math:: 

   C_p = \frac{C_p^*}{R^*} \quad \mathrm{and} \quad C_v = \frac{C_v^*}{R^*}\,.

Finally, a reference dynamic viscosity is defined, to help make 
nondimensional the viscous stress tensor and the heat flux vector, such that:

.. math:: 

   \mu_R^* = \rho_R^* U_R^* L_R^* \quad \Rightarrow \quad \mu = \frac{\mu^*}{\mu^*_R}

By substituting the above expressions in the governing equations, 
it is possible to obtain the following nondimensional form: 

.. math::

   \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial \rho u_i}{\partial x_i}  = 0

.. math::

   \frac{\partial \rho u_i}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial \rho u_i}{\partial x_j} = -\frac{\partial p}{\partial x_i} + \frac{\partial \sigma_{ij}}{\partial x_j}

.. math::

   \frac{\partial \rho E}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial \rho u_j H}{\partial x_j} = - \frac{\partial q_j}{\partial x_j} + \frac{\sigma_{ij} u_i}{\partial x_j}

.. math::

   p = \rho T

where

.. math::

   \sigma_{ij} = \mu \left( \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j} 
                          + \frac{\partial u_j}{\partial x_i}
              - \frac{2}{3} \frac{\partial u_k}{\partial x_k} 
                                                  \delta_{ij} \right)

.. math::

   q_j = - \frac{\mu C_p}{Pr} \frac{\partial T}{\partial x_j}\,

and

.. math::

   e = \int_{1}^{T} C_v(T)\,\mathrm{d} T \quad \mathrm{and} \quad 
   h = \int_{1}^{T} C_p(T)\,\mathrm{d} T \, .

We stress that the reference dynamic viscosity does **not** coincide with 
the dynamic viscosity at the reference temperature. In particular, 
one has that: 

.. math::

   \mu = \frac{\mu^*}{\mu^*_R} = \frac{\mu^*(T_R^*)}{\mu^*_R} f(T) = \mu_{T_R} f(T)\,.

This quantity is evaluated as a function of the nondimensional flow parameters provided by the user in the input (Mach number, Reynolds number, Eckert number), 
whose specific meaning for various flow cases implemented in STREAmS is presented 
below.

The main parameters of each case are reported in the following. 
ASTERISCHI!!!

-------------------------------------
Compressible plane channel flow
-------------------------------------

.. image:: ./figures/Channel_case.png
   :width: 600

Simulations of the compressible plane channel flow 
are carried out imposing a constant flow rate. 
The height of the domain :math:`L_y` is equal to :math:`2\,h`, 
where :math:`h` thus indicates the half-height of the channel. 

*Bulk quantites* are indicated with :math:`B` subscript and are defined as: 

- bulk density
.. math::

   \rho_B = \frac{1}{V} \int_V \rho\, \mathrm{d}V

- bulk velocity
.. math::

   U_B = \frac{1}{\rho_B\,V} \int_V \rho\,u\, \mathrm{d}V

- bulk temperature
.. math::

   T_B = \frac{1}{\rho_B\,U_B\,V} \int_V \rho\,u\,T\, \mathrm{d}V

where :math:`V` is the volume of the computational domain, 
:math:`\rho` is the density, 
:math:`u` is the streamwise velocity, 
and :math:`T` is the temperature.  

*Reference quantities* are indicated with :math:`R` subscript and are defined as:

- reference length
.. math::

   L_R = h

- reference density
.. math::

   \rho_R = \rho_B

- reference temperature
.. math::

   T_R = T_w

- reference velocity
.. math::

   U_R = \sqrt{R\,T_w}

- reference time
.. math::

   t_R = L_R/U_R

where :math:`T_w` is the wall temperature, and :math:`R` is the gas constant.

Relevant flow *nondimensional parameters* are: 

- estimated friction Reynolds number 
.. math::

   Re_\tau = \frac{u_\tau\,h}{\nu_w}

- bulk Reynolds number based on the bulk temperature
.. math::

   Re_B = \frac{\rho_B\,U_B\,h}{\mu(T_B)}

- bulk Reynolds number based on the wall temperature
.. math::

   \widetilde{Re}_B = \frac{\rho_B\,U_B\,h}{\mu(T_w)}

- bulk Mach number based on the bulk temperature
.. math::

   M_B = \frac{U_B}{\sqrt{\gamma\,R\,T_B}}

- bulk Mach number based on the wall temperature
.. math::

   \widetilde{M}_B = \frac{U_B}{\sqrt{\gamma\,R\,T_w}}

where :math:`u_\tau` is the friction velocity, 
:math:`\nu_w` is the kinematic viscosity at the wall, 
:math:`\mu(T)` is the dynamic viscosity at temperature :math:`T`, 
and :math:`\gamma = C_p/C_v` is the heat capacity ratio, 
obtained dividing the specific heat capacity at constant pressure :math:`C_p`
by the specific heat capacity at constant volume :math:`C_v`.

For what concerns the bulk temperature, two different options are available for the simulations:

-- *Fixed bulk temperature.* In this case, the user must supply the code 
with the desired values of :math:`M_B`, :math:`Re_\tau`, and an 
estimate of :math:`\theta` in the input file. 
The code provides the corresponding values of :math:`\widetilde{M}_B`, 
:math:`\widetilde{Re}_B`, and :math:`Re_B`. CITA COLEMANN e MODESTI 

-- *Freely-evolving bulk temperature.* In this case, the user must supply the 
code with the desired values of :math:`\widetilde{M}_B` and 
:math:`Re_\tau` only, while :math:`\theta` must be set to 
a value less than :math:`-1`. 
The code provides the value of :math:`\widetilde{Re}_B`, and 
an estimate of :math:`M_B` and :math:`Re_B`. CITA ROUGHNESS JFM

In the case of the compressible plane channel flow, 
the reference temperature :math:`T_R^*` 
is assumed to be the wall temperature :math:`T_w^*`, 
and thus by considering the definition of the reference 
dynamic viscosity, one has that:

.. math::

   \mu_{T_R} = \frac{\mu^*(T_w^*)}{\mu_R^*} = \frac{\mu^*(T_w^*)}{\rho_B^* U_B^* h^*} \frac{\rho_B^* U_B^* h^*}{\rho_R^* U_R^* L_R^*} = \sqrt{\gamma(T_w)} \frac{\widetilde{M}_B}{\widetilde{Re}_B}\,.

-------------------------------------
Compressible boundary layer
-------------------------------------

.. image:: ./figures/BLay_case.png
   :width: 600

Simulations of the compressible boundary layer
are carried out imposing a null pressure gradient. 

*Reference quantities* are indicated with :math:`R` 
subscript and are defined as:

- reference length
.. math::

   L_R = \delta_0

- reference density
.. math::

   \rho_R = \rho_\infty

- reference temperature 
.. math::

   T_R = T_\infty

- reference velocity
.. math::

   U_R = \sqrt{R\,T_\infty}

- reference time
.. math::

   t_R = L_R/U_R

where :math:`\delta_0` is the boundary layer thickness at the 
beginning of the domain (???), :math:`\rho_\infty` is 
the free-stream density, and :math:`T_\infty` is 
the free-stream temperature.

Relevant flow *nondimensional parameters* are: 

- estimated friction Reynolds number 
.. math::

   Re_\tau = \frac{u_\tau\,\delta_0}{\nu_w}

- free-stream Mach number
.. math::

   M_\infty = \frac{U_\infty}{\sqrt{\gamma\,R\,T_\infty}}

where :math:`U_\infty` is the free-stream velocity.

In the case of the compressible boundary layer, 
the reference temperature :math:`T_R^*` 
is assumed to be the free-stream temperature :math:`T_\infty^*`, 
and thus by considering the definition of the reference 
dynamic viscosity, one has that:

.. math::

   \mu_{T_R} = \frac{\mu^*(T_\infty^*)}{\mu_R^*} = \frac{\mu^*(T_\infty^*)}{\rho_\infty^* U_\infty^* \delta^*} \frac{\rho_\infty^* U_\infty^* \delta^*}{\rho_R^* U_R^* L_R^*} = \sqrt{\gamma(T_\infty)} \frac{M_\infty}{Re_\infty}\,.

-------------------------------------
Shock wave/boundary layer interaction
-------------------------------------

.. image:: ./figures/SBLI_case.png
   :width: 600

Simulations of the shock wave/boundary layer interaction
assume that an oblique shock wave from the top surface of the domain 
impinges on a boundary layer developing on the flat bottom surface. 

*Reference quantities* are indicated with :math:`R` subscript and, 
as in the case of the compressible boundary layer, are defined as:

- reference length
.. math::

   L_R = \delta_0

- reference density
.. math::

   \rho_R = \rho_\infty

- reference temperature 
.. math::

   T_R = T_\infty

- reference velocity
.. math::

   U_R = \sqrt{R\,T_\infty}

- reference time
.. math::

   t_R = L_R/U_R

where :math:`\delta_0` is the thickness of the undisturbed 
boundary layer at the beginning of the domain. (???)

Relevant flow *nondimensional parameters*, as in  
the case of the compressible boundary layer, are: 

- estimated friction Reynolds number 
.. math::

   Re_\tau = \frac{u_\tau\,\delta_0}{\nu_w}

- free-stream Mach number
.. math::

   M_\infty = \frac{U_\infty}{\sqrt{\gamma\,R\,T_\infty}}

In order to define the shock system, the user must provide also 
the two following parameters: 

- the *shock impingment location* :math:`x_{imp}^s`, which is the longitudinal coordinate where the impinging shock would intersect the bottom surface.

- The *shock wave angle* :math:`\phi^s`, which is the acute angle between the shock and the top (or bottom) surface.
